Milder Critical Hit/Fumble Cards for PF2e

Do you love Pathfinder's 4 degress of succsss but find that Natural 20s and Natural 1s are not as exciting as you would like?  Have you tried the Crit Cards but been floored by their insta-death possibilities.  Maybe Milder Critcards is right for you!

The intent here is that when attackers roll a natural 20, in addition to the normal damage this will apply a random status effect to the target as a bonus for Critical Hit on a 20. When the attacker rolls a natural 1, they instead will recive a random status effect to represend the Critical Fumble penalty for rolling an 1.
